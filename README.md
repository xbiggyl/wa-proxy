# WhatsApp Proxy (Meta â†’ N8N + Chatwoot)

This repository contains a small Node.js proxy that routes messages from the **WhatsApp Cloud API** to your **N8N workflow** and optionally mirrors them to **Chatwoot**.

This proxy simplifies the process of integrating WhatsApp with a custom backend or workflow engine like N8N, while allowing you to keep a record of all conversations in Chatwoot.
